Cut that at the roots with organizing your SCSS files separately related to the component, template or page view.\r\n\r\n##Responsive from the start\r\nAdapting the site to the plethora of devices is a battle inside itself. Win it constantly by using built-in classes and media queries and build upon that with your own customized code.\r\n\r\nCheckout the demo:\r\nIt's pretty ugly but you know better than to expect a boilerplate to be good looking, right?\r\n[http://waterlee.jakesharp.co](http://waterlee.jakesharp.co)\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nOnce you install the Waterlee package and assuming you already installed the \"Jake Sharp\" extension used for the main category menu which is packed within the theme package., go to your Magento administration backend and look for \"Jake Sharp\" theme settings under \"System -> Configuration | Configuration -> JAKESHARP WATERLEE -> Theme Settings -> Enable\" to enable the theme's menu.\r\n\r\n##SCSS Organization\r\nFor starters, Waterlee is based on ZURB Foundation framework 4.0 which relies on mobile first approach. This means that all of the HTML classes for layout at your disposal are mobile-first so keep that in mind while developing. There is a folder named \"custom\" under the \"/skin/frontend/waterlee-boilerplate/default/SCSS/\".\r\n\r\nThe \"custom\" folder is already configured following the OOCSS principles of separating as many styling areas such as: page views, global components etc. All of the files are then imported into one main style.scss. Feel free to adapt it to your needs or not use it at all. Our recommendation is that you build upon it, suggest improvements for organization or just first take it for a spin to see the benefits.\r\n\r\nIt's refreshing to have the that final SCSS organized by maintaining focus using separate .scss files where you can easily find redundant code. If you get lost you can always find that HTML class using the find function in your IDE.\r\n\r\nWhat's inside:\r\n- **NEW** All of the Foundation Javascript is now placed in the footer for faster loading.\r\n- **NEW** Theme top menu extension. Find it under \"JAKE SHARP WATERLEE\" system settings after installation (Remember, you'll need to install the extension separately.)\r\n- **NEW**: Off Canvas menu (http://www.zurb.com/playground/off-canvas-layouts)\r\n- **NEW**: Current SubCategory menu for mobile view\r\n- Foundation 4 by ZURB built in (http://foundation.zurb.com/)\r\n- OOCSS SASS implemented (http://compass-style.org/)\r\n- Local XML for layout overrides\r\n- Implemented classes that adhere to foundation docs\r\n\r\n\r\n##What's next:\r\n\r\n- Implementing \"Interchange\" for loading images based on media query [http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/interchange.html]\r\n- Implementing \"Abide\" for form validation [http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/abide.html] \r\n","google":"UA-8426827-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
