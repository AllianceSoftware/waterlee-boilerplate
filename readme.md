 - Built on latest Foundation 3 by ZURB.

##This is an alpha version

Released into the wild before it's time has come.
Ment as a starting base of your *responsive* Magento theme.

**!Important!** - I worked hard on implementing the foundation responsivness
but the theme itself is not *styled* yet as such. That's planned for next
seven days when *Beta* is released. 
 

What's inside:
*NEW*:
- Off Canvas menu (http://www.zurb.com/playground/off-canvas-layouts)
- Current SubCategory menu for mobile view
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Foundation 3 by ZURB built in (http://foundation.zurb.com/)  
- SASS implemented (http://compass-style.org/)
- Templates files ridden of divitis
- Local XML for layout overrides
- Implemented classes that adhere to foundation docs 


##What's next:

- Getting the theme ready for beta release
- Recieving your feedback and participation to make this worthwile for everyone
- Improving this readme with refferences and more info

Currently, demo is unavailable but at this point it's not about the looks, 
download it, test it and please do provide a constructive feedback.
