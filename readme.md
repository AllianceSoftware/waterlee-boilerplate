#Magento HTML5 responsive boilerplate [![endorse](http://api.coderwall.com/zeljkoprsa/endorsecount.png)](http://coderwall.com/zeljkoprsa)
 - Built on latest Foundation 3 by ZURB.

**Update**
## Waterlee on Foundation 4.x is in the works

Making the boilerplate from scratch using the latest foundation 4 and keeping our mind
on the Foundation 5 release that's apparently being released in the near future.

All of the changes will be documented on the wiki pages here on github.

##Public Beta

The theme itself is still rough around the edges but you now have 
pretty much everything you need to start creating your own theme.

Remember this is a boilerplate not a production ready theme ;)

You can see the demo at http://waterlee.jakesharp.co

What's inside:

- **NEW**: Off Canvas menu (http://www.zurb.com/playground/off-canvas-layouts)
- **NEW**: Current SubCategory menu for mobile view
- Foundation 3 by ZURB built in (http://foundation.zurb.com/)  
- SASS implemented (http://compass-style.org/)
- Templates files ridden of divitis
- Local XML for layout overrides
- Implemented classes that adhere to foundation docs 


##What's next:

- Getting the theme ready for beta release
- Receiving your feedback and participation to make this worthwile for everyone
